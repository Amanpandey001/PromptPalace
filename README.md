The project is over... i wont be adding user search feature and click on tag to search feature... u can just search tags in search bar to search for prompts.. damn too many 'search' :D

make sure u have mongodb,nodejs
use npm i to install all the dependencies and modules needed :D make sure to make your own .env file before running project

```
.env sample:

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
MONGODB_URI=
NEXTAUTH_URL=
NEXTAUTH_URL_INTERNAL=
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=
```
